<h2 class='post-header'>Rules</h2>

Each game satisfying *all* of the following conditions is eligible to be 'league game':

1. The armies of both players
  * are battle-forged
  * each have a minimum of 1000 points (not power level)
2. Both players agree that the game is a league game before the game starts
3. The game is played at the Tactica GbmH
4. The result of the game is submitted to the according list in the store after the game and validated by both players

The league functions as follows:

+ League games are collected on a weekly basis
+ The scores will be updated every Monday
+ There are two types of rankings:
  * Overall: The players are ranked to their overall points (see below for an explanation on how the scores are computed)
  * Best in Faction: *After week 4*, there will be scores for each faction that is played by at least one person.
  All games played by a player X with faction Y will be counted in the faction ranking for Y.

**Clarification: This does not mean that you are restricted to only play one faction. Rather, every game with a faction adds to your respective faction score as well as your overall score. This means that you can have several factions scores (for every faction you at least played once), which in sum result in your overall score.**

This is how the scores are computed:
0. Every loss always scores 0 points
1. Up to week 4, each win scores 1 point
2. After week 4, we will set up three player categories for the overall ranking:
  + Gold: The best 3 players
  + Silver: Place 4-8
  + Bronze: Place 9-n
3. From 2. on, the point scores for each win will be adapted to the levels of the competing players. A win against a player on..
  + the same level scores 1 point
  + a higher level scores 1.25 points
  + a lower level scores 0.75 points
