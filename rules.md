<h2 class='post-header'>Rules</h2>

**Disclaimer**: If you feel that the rules raise serious issues or have other recommendations/ideas, please <a href="mailto:luciengeorges.baumgartner@uzh.ch?subject=feedback">contact us</a>. The league is no way monetized, we all do this in our leisure time. Please keep that in mind.

<h3 class='rules-sub'>What is a league game</h3>

<p class='tldr'> tldr; play at the store, with a minimum of 1000 points, battle-forged. </p>

Each game satisfying *all* of the following conditions is eligible to be 'league game':

1. The armies of both players
  * are battle-forged
  * each have a minimum of 1000 points (not power level)
2. Both players agree that the game is a league game before the game starts
3. The game is played at the Tactica GbmH
4. The result of the game is submitted to the according list in the store after the game and validated by both players

<h3 class='rules-sub'>How does the league work?</h3>

<p class='tldr'> tldr; either aim for total victory or try to be the dominant Hive Fleet on the table - or both. </p>

The league functions as follows:

+ League games are collected on a weekly basis
+ The scores will be updated every Monday
+ There are two types of rankings:
  * Overall: The players are ranked to their overall points (see below for an explanation on how the scores are computed)
  * Best in Faction: *After week 4*, there will be scores for each faction that is played by at least one person.
  All games played by a player X with faction Y will be counted in the faction ranking for Y.

**Clarification: This does not mean that you are restricted to only play one faction. Rather, every game with a faction adds to your respective faction score as well as your overall score. This means that you can have several factions scores (for every faction you at least played once), which in sum result in your overall score.**

<h3 class='rules-sub'>How do I score points</h3>

<p class='tldr'> tldr; by winning. </p>

This is how the scores are computed:

0. Every loss always scores 0 points
1. Up to week 4, each win scores 1 point
2. After week 4, we will set up three player categories for the overall ranking:
  + Gold: The best 3 players
  + Silver: Place 4-8
  + Bronze: Place 9-n
3. From 2. on, the point scores for each win will be adapted to the levels of the competing players. A win against a player on..
  + the same level scores 1 point
  + a higher level scores 1.25 points
  + a lower level scores 0.75 points
4. The level of each player, starting with 2., is determined by his scores from the week before
5. Level ups and downs will be noted in the ranking
6. The level difference for faction scores to determine the Best in Faction ranking is the same as for the overall scores; there are no separate Best in Faction levels

<h3 class='rules-sub'>Prize support</h3>

<p class='tldr'> tldr; no cash, only glory and .... </p>

Since we do not demand any monetary contribution to compete in the league, we cannot hand out cash prizes for the winners. There will we hand made ..., though. The three best of each category will receive those, as well as the Best in Faction for each faction respectively.
